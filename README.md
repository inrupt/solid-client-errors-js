`@inrupt/solid-client-errors` is a JavaScript library for handling [RFC9457 Problem Details](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) on HTTP error responses.

# Server support

This feature is currently available in ESS. Servers implementing [RFC9457 Problem Details](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457) will be supported too.

# Supported environments

Our JavaScript Client Libraries use relatively modern JavaScript, aligned with
the [ES2020](https://262.ecma-international.org/11.0/) Specification features, we
ship both [ESM](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/esm.html) and
[CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/modules.html), with type
definitions for TypeScript alongside.

This means that out of the box, we only support environments (browsers or
runtimes) that were released after mid-2020, if you wish to target other (older)
environments, then you will need to cross-compile our SDKs via the use of
[Babel](https://babeljs.io), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/),
[SWC](https://swc.rs/), or similar.

If you need support for Internet Explorer, it is recommended to pass them
through a tool like [Babel](https://babeljs.io), and to add polyfills for e.g.
`Map`, `Set`, `Promise`, `Headers`, `Array.prototype.includes`, `Object.entries`
and `String.prototype.endsWith`.

## Node.js Support

Our JavaScript Client Libraries track Node.js [LTS
releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), and support 18.x, 20.x, and 22.x.
